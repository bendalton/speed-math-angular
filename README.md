# CalebMath

I'm creating this project to help my son with his "speed math" from school.
The students have a goal of being able to do 100 "simple math facts" in 5 minutes by the end of 2nd grade.

These "simple math facts" are basic addition problems (e.g., 3+15)

This will be a tool/game to get the high score in 30 seconds, 5 minutes, etc.

I'm using Angular and aim to host on github pages for free.
